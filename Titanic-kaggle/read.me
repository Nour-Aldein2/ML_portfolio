This is an attempt to predict the survival/death of the titanic passengers answering to Kaggle competition (see: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

As you can see in the IPython file, there are a lot of figures that helped in the feature engineering in order to improve the predictions of the used models.
I used ensemble learning to achieve a score of 0.80622 on the Leaderbord (which is top 3% result at the submission time).
Using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to make the predictions and then using both models to vote on the final prediction was the basic idea behind this work.


You will be also able to see two files with the extension html. Those files are interactive graphs that helped in the analysis. You can download them and explore the data!
